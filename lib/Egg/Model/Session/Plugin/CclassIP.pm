=head1 NAME

Egg::Model::Session::Plugin::CclassIP - Plugin for session that confirms C class agreement of IP address.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp::Model::Sesion::MySession;
  
  __PACKAGE__->startup(
   Plugin::CclassIP
   .....
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When IP address is not corresponding at C class level, it is a plugin for the 
session to treat as another session.

IP address at that time is preserved when a new session is opened, and C class 
part of the IP address will be confirmed next time.

To use it, 'Plugin::CclassIP' is added to 'startup'.

Moreover, 'init_session' is done in override, and note the competition with other
components, please.

Besides, there is L<Egg::Model::Session::Plugin::AbsoluteIP> confirmed at C class
level, too. However, please note that it is not efficiency with this plugin 
simultaneously that uses.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init_session

A new session is begun when not agreeing to IP address before at C class level.
